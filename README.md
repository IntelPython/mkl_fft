## ``mkl_fft`` --  a NumPy-based Python interface to Intel (R) MKL FFT functionality

`mkl_fft` started as a part of Intel (R) Distribution for Python* optimizations to NumPy, and is now being released 
as a stand-alone package. It can be installed into conda environment using 

```
   conda install -c intel mkl_fft
```

Since MKL FFT supports performing discrete Fourier transforms over non-contiguously laid out arrays, MKL can be directly
used on any well-behaved floating point array with no internal overlaps for both in-place and not in-place transforms of 
arrays in single and double floating point precision.

This eliminates the need to copy input array contiguously into an intermediate buffer.

`mkl_fft` directly supports N-dimensional Fourier transforms.

More details can be found in SciPy 2017 conference proceedings:

It implements the following functions:

### Complex transforms, similar to those in `scipy.fftpack`:

`fft(x, n=None, axis=-1, overwrite_x=False)`

`ifft(x, n=None, axis=-1, overwrite_x=False)`

`fft2(x, shape=None, axes=(-2,-1), overwrite_x=False)`

`ifft2(x, shape=None, axes=(-2,-1), overwrite_x=False)`

`fftn(x, n=None, axes=None, overwrite_x=False)`

`ifftn(x, n=None, axes=None, overwrite_x=False)`

### Real transforms

`rfft(x, n=None, axis=-1, overwrite_x=False)` - real 1D Fourier transform, like `scipy.fftpack.rfft`

`rfft_numpy(x, n=None, axis=-1)` - real 1D Fourier transform, like `numpy.fft.rfft`

`rfft2_numpy(x, s=None, axes=(-2,-1))` - real 2D Fourier transform, like `numpy.fft.rfft2`

`rfftn_numpy(x, s=None, axes=None)` - real 2D Fourier transform, like `numpy.fft.rfftn`

... and similar `irfft*` functions.


The package also provides `mkl_fft._numpy_fft` and `mkl_fft._scipy_fft` interfaces which provide drop-in replacements for equivalent functions in NumPy and SciPy respectively.

To build ``mkl_fft`` from sources on Linux:
  - install a recent version of MKL, if necessary;
  - execute ``source /path/to/mklroot/bin/mklvars.sh intel64`` ; 
  - execute ``pip install .``
